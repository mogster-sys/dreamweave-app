# üöÄ Quick APK Solutions (Gradle Failed)

The local Gradle build failed due to Expo module conflicts. Here are working alternatives:

## Option 1: Online Build Service (Fastest)
```bash
# Use Expo's cloud build (no local setup needed)
npx eas-cli login
npx eas build --platform android --profile preview
```
This creates an APK in the cloud and gives you a download link.

## Option 2: Simple PWA (Works Immediately)
```bash
# Create installable web app
npm run web
# Then on your phone: visit the URL and "Add to Home Screen"
```

## Option 3: Use Android Studio (Most Reliable)
1. Install Android Studio on Windows
2. Copy project to Windows
3. Open in Android Studio
4. Build ‚Üí Generate Signed Bundle/APK

## Option 4: Cordova Conversion
```bash
npm install -g cordova
cordova create dreamweave com.dreamweave.app DreamWeave
# Copy www folder and build
```

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ App is fully functional
- ‚ùå Local Android build failed (WSL + Expo modules conflict)
- üéØ Need alternative build approach

**Recommendation: Try Option 1 (EAS build) - it handles all the complex setup remotely.**
