# Direct Android Build in Progress 🔥

## What's Happening
- ✅ Generated native Android project with `expo prebuild`
- ⏳ Building APK with Gradle (takes 5-10 minutes first time)
- 🎯 Will create installable APK file

## APK Location
Once build completes, APK will be at:
```
android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

## Installation Steps
1. **Transfer APK to phone** (USB, email, cloud storage)
2. **Enable "Install from Unknown Sources"** in Android settings
3. **Tap APK file** to install
4. **Grant microphone permission** when prompted

## Alternative: Use Build Service
If local build fails, we can use Expo's cloud build:
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

## Current Status
- ✅ All DreamWeave features implemented
- ✅ Native Android project generated  
- ⏳ APK building now (gradle daemon starting)
- 🎯 Direct device install (no Expo Go needed)

**This approach bypasses all WSL networking issues!**
